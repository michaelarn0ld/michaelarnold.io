            I graduated Cum Laude with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from California State
            Polytechnic University, Pomona. The time I spent at my alma mater represents a
            period of constant trial and growth, and I loved every minute of it. Studying
            engineering transformed the way I think about and interact with the world; it
            made me an adept problem solver, confident to tackle any of life's challenges.

            While I was an undergrad, I had the opportunity to work on amazing problems with
            my adivsor; my senior research was focused in the area of catalytic pyrolysis, a
            thermochemical technique to upcycle plastic wastes into valuable materials. I
            am honored to have had this work published in the Journal of Renewable and
            Sustainable Energy. If you are interested in learning more about this, you can

            I discovered my love for computing during my degree; it started with some
            Arduino tinkering and quickly blossomed into my life's passion. Since then, I
            have been tireless in learning new tech and builidng projects to reinforce those
            skills. If you haven't already, make sure to check out

            In the space of computing, I am most keen on the technology that empowers the
            web. Whether it's client-side or server-side I am interested in it all. As an
            autodidact, I make an effort to keep my skills fresh and stay up to date with
            the latest skills demanded by the rapidly changing tech landscape. Currently, I
            have demostrated proficiency in the following languages and technologies:
