                <p class="about-me-content">Hey! My name's Michael. I am a technologist and software engineer with
                an aptitude for developing infrastructure and scalable systems. Born and raised in California, I left the gorgeous
                Golden State after college to pursue tech in Austin, Texas. Since then, I have returned to California
                where I now work at Amazon Web Services in the Bay Area.</p>
                <p class="about-me-content">When I'm not
                thinking about tech, you'll find me training at the gym, exploring the city for the best eats, clearing my mind
                with a hike through the mountains, or snowboarding in the winter.</p>
                <p class="about-me-content">
                If you would like to get a better sense of my engineering proficiencies,

            I graduated Cum Laude with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from California State
            Polytechnic University, Pomona. The time I spent at my alma mater represents a
            period of constant trial and growth, and I loved every minute of it. Studying
            engineering transformed the way I think about and interact with the world; it
            made me an adept problem solver, confident to tackle any of life's challenges.

            While I was an undergrad, I had the opportunity to work on amazing problems with
            my adivsor; my senior research was focused in the area of catalytic pyrolysis, a
            thermochemical technique to upcycle plastic wastes into valuable materials. I
            am honored to have had this work published in the Journal of Renewable and
            Sustainable Energy. If you are interested in learning more about this, you can

            My primary driver in life, aside from computer science, is health and
            fitness. I have been consistently training for nearly 10 years at this
            point and consider it to the be the most crucial part of my lifestyle.
            I have found that regular, disciplined exercise and clean eating promotes
            structure and a strong foundation which cascades to the other areas of
            my life. Besides this, it is also simply just great fun and rewarding
            to work on a physique that I can be proud of.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me-content">
            Most of my training has been centered around weightlifting and
            bodybuilding style exercises; however, I have occasionally mixed
            it up over the years with a combination of powerlifting, calisthenics,
            bodybuilding, and anything else that has caught my interest. Currently,
            my goals are simple: become bigger, stronger, leaner, and faster. I
            want to maximize my natural genetic potential to see how far I can
            take my body.

            I discovered my love for computing during my degree; it started with some
            Arduino tinkering and quickly blossomed into my life's passion. Since then, I
            have been tireless in learning new tech and builidng projects to reinforce those
            skills. If you haven't already, make sure to check out

            In the space of computing, I am most keen on the technology that empowers the
            web. Whether it's client-side or server-side I am interested in it all. As an
            autodidact, I make an effort to keep my skills fresh and stay up to date with
            the latest skills demanded by the rapidly changing tech landscape. Currently, I
            have demostrated proficiency in the following languages and technologies:
